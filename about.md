I literally want to learn and do everything.  I have a degree in music, work in information systems, and at one point had a photography business on the side. But what’s most important is that I’m a husband and a father. My wife and my two children are the best things in my life.

I was born and raised in the geographical center of British Columbia, but prefer to live in cities due to my appetite for restaurants, high-speed internet, and bookstores. I’ve lived in three countries, six states, and one federal district (México). I once ate a roasted ant. It tasted like bacon-bits.
