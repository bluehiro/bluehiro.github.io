In an effort to get this simple blog website up and running I am creating this temp post.

Now using Pixyll layout, plus github now features:

* Line anchors in code blocks and new syntax highlighting
* A customizable variables file
* Modular, and lighter weight CSS
* No more `max-width` media queries
