After some requests on facebook, I wanted to give a quick and simple guide to preparing chicken for including with indian food. Specifically the Coconut Curry and Vindaloo sauces currently being sold at Costco.

What you need

* A sharp knife (not serrated)
* Skillet or frying pan
* A cutting board
* Thawed chicken breast
* Vegetable oil

Take your thawed chicken breast, cut off any fatty bits (unless you LIKE the fatty bits). Then thin slice the chicken as shown in this wonderful youtube video;

Note: this will be really hard with a dull knife. Do it slow and careful so you don't cut yourself.

Add a little oil to your frying pan over a medium to medium-low heat. Cook the chicken until it is just starting to turn golden and is STILL MOIST. If there is lots of water in the pan, drain it so that the chicken can brown (wet meat won't brown). Feel free to break the pieces of chicken into smaller pieces now that they're mostly cooked.

With your chicken cooked, throw it in a pot with your Coconut Curry or Vindaloo sauce and simmer for 15-20 minutes. The cut of the chicken will allow the sauces to work their way inside the meat.

Good luck!
